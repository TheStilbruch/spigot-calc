# spigot-calc
A Spigot plugin that features a simple calculator

# Why did I go with a GUI?
With this project I was limited to 3 hours to complete it. I was not allowed to use any outside code. 
Because of this, I had to write a new GUI lib from scratch for this plugin. In a more realistic development
situation, I would be able to use libraries I had written which would drasticlly speed up dev time.

# What would I have done with more time?
My original idea was for a hologram calculator that the player interacted with, but because I was limited to 3
hours I went with the safer GUI option. I would have rather had a finished projecct that was a little more boring
than an unfinished one that was super exciting.

# Why didn't I add more features?
With this challege, I was under the impression that finishing as fast as possible was the goal, and so I stopped as soon 
as I had a featureset I was happy with. If the goal had been to do as much as I could in 3 hours, I would have added more.
